# Wildfire Spread Analysis in Northeast Portugal
### Overview
Forest fires pose a major threat to both human life and the environment. This project investigates wildfire behavior in the northeast region of Portugal, a region particularly vulnerable due to its extensive forest coverage and dry summer climate. With forests becoming increasingly dry and communities expanding closer to them, understanding wildfire dynamics has become more critical than ever.

Our focus is to analyze the relationship between Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) and Initial Spread Index (ISI) — two key components of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index system — to better understand how quickly wildfires spread under varying conditions. This research serves environmental scientists, ecologists, and fire management agencies seeking to reduce wildfire risks and improve public safety.

### Research Question
How does Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) help us understand how quickly a fire spreads in the northeast region of Portugal?

### Objectives
* Understand the relationship between FFMC (an indicator of forest floor dryness) and ISI (a measure of initial fire spread speed).
* Develop regression models to quantify the relationship.
* Apply variable transformation techniques to improve model performance.
* Evaluate both statistical and practical significance of the results.
* Provide actionable insights that can inform wildfire prevention strategies.
